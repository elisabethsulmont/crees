A new  entry is added to the Add-ons menu of the Google Sheets page when the add-on is installed.

The *Crisis Event Extraction Service (CREES)* submenu adds the following entries:
* *Edit API Endpoint*: If you need to use your own publically available CREES API installation, you can modify the default URI of the server API.
* *Reset API Endpoint*: This item reset the API URI address to its default value.
* *About CREES*: This items shows a small description of CREES and the Add-on features.

Only modify the API Endpoint if you have your own CREES server that is exposed publicly. If you are unsure, it is better to leave this setting alone.
